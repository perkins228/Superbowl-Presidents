# Subject: Presidential Election vs Superbowl Results

Good Morning Sean,

As promised, we have completed the requested analysis of US presidential election results and Superbowl winners.  
We did run into some challenges with the initial data set for US presidents. The initial data set had votes by year, by state, and by the candidate. With the quick turnaround time needed for your results, we decided to go with a different data set.

If after reviewing the results you feel you would like to have a more in-depth look, we would be more than happy to conduct and more comprehensive set of results for you. 
We were able to complete this request under the budget timeline given. Thus, allowing more time to evaluate the results received and make any last-minute adjustment needed.  All the results can be found by following the GitHub link:[Election vs Superbowl REsults] (https://github.com/perkins228/Superbowl-Presidents.git)

Attached is the final proposal which includes our timeline and a breakdown of how we received this data. If interested follow the GitHub link for a complete summary and additional screenshots.

On behalf of our team, I would like to thank you for entrusting us with this project and the quick turnaround time needed.
Feel free to let us know if there are any questions, concerns, or any additional information needed.
All the best,
Tiffany McGowan; JHU Bootcamp
